    <h2>Briana Edmundson</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Briana Edmundson, a Fashion Communications professional and luxury PR specialist currently expanding my knowledge into the world of finance. With a strong background in event coordination, influencer relations, and media strategy through roles at Karla Otto, KCD Worldwide, and Christian Louboutin, I thrive in high-paced, detail-oriented environments. I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Finance at Rutgers University and recently completed my BBA in Fashion Marketing at LIM College.</p>

    <p>I created Reverz to address a personal frustration with slow and irreversible money transfers. By blending my creative background in fashion and communications with technical exploration in blockchain, I aim to develop solutions that are both innovative and user-friendly. My goal is to use technology to solve everyday problems—especially in spaces where convenience, security, and user experience matter most.</p>
